This is a project we did for Noroff Frontend Developer course. The project is a webshop for a fictional company called Epari. The project is built with React.

## Description

Here you can register as a user and login if you have a proper @stud.noroff.no/@noroff.no email and create/view listings and products. You can also add these to your cart and checkout which is fully working but not connected to any payment system.

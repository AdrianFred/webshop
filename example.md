# Epari | Js Frameworks CA

## Overview

This is a project we did for Noroff Frontend Developer course. The project is a webshop for a fictional company called Epari. The project is built with React.
Here you can register as a user and login if you have a proper @stud.noroff.no/@noroff.no email and create/view listings and products. You can also add these to your cart and checkout which is fully working but not connected to any payment system.
For now theres 3 pages which is Home, shopping-cart and a contact page. Home is where you can view products and also search for specific items, shopping-cart is where you can view your cart and contact page is where you have a contact form with validation.
